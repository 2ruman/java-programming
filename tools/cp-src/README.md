This script is to copy src directory in staging project path to current directory.
The staging project path would be not for updating to server but just for testing or scribbling.
So, we're standing by current directory for server-update like pushing to github.
The staging project path must be set as an environment variable so that we don't need to input as a parameter of this script, plus this script might as well be copied to /bin, /usr/bin or your own for direct execution.
